# snake game

This is a simple python snake game which we can use for fun. The speed of the snake can be adjusted when followed the code. Reduce the delay if you want the snake to move very fast or increase the **clock tick** time from 0 to 10 range, decrease the **clock tick**speed if you want snake to move very slow.
